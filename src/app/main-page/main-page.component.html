                    TOXTRUST is an open-source Python-based tool specifically designed for applying the Dempster-Shafer Theory to hazard-related toxicological questions. TOXTRUST allows translating computational and experimental results into objective decisions and provides a rigorous way to consider the epistemic uncertainty. The proposed approach is not endpoint-specific and can be applied to communicate the degrees of confidence for single elements of toxicological evidence and to combine toxicological results to a single hazard estimate expressed by means of probability bounds.
